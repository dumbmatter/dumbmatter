I've done a bunch of stuff over the years, but these days I am mostly working on [ZenGM](https://zengm.com/), my indie video game business. If you are a nerdy sports fan, go try managing a team in any of the major American sports 🏀 🏈 ⚾ 🏒

And if you're really nerdy, [take a look at the source code too](https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm).
